# Week one

What are the basic tasks that all software engineering projects must handle?

Give a one sentence description of each of the tasks you listed above.

## From slide 14 of powerpoint

* Requirements gathering (Marsic)
* Design (Gomaa, 2011)
* Development (Marsic)
* Testing (Marsic)
* Validation (Gomaa, 2011)
* Verification (Gomaa, 2011)
* Deployment (Marsic)
* Maintenance (Marsic)

## Requirements gathering 

Requirements gathering is a process to determine the customer, business problem, methodology, and functionality of the system (Marsic) in order to determine "what the system's external behavior is without describing how the system works internally" (Gomaa, 2011).

## Design

The design task of a software engineering process has two components: architectural design, which specifies the "structure of the system, in terms of components and their interconnections" and detailed design, which defines the "algorithmic details of each system component" (Gomaa, 2011).

## Development 

Developers use "the programming language selected for the project" (Gomaa, 2011) to "develop & test code to the requirements" (Marsic).

## Testing 

The system can be tested with unit tests, integration tests, and system tests. Unit/integration tests require "knowledge of the internals of software" and system testing is "based on the software requirements specification, without knowledge of the software internals" (Gomaa, 2011).

## Validation 

Software validation, which ensures the team "builds the right system", in that it "conforms to the user's needs" (Gomaa, 2011). 

## Verification 

Somewhat related to validation, software verification ensures the team "builds the system right", in that "each phase of the software system is built according to the specification defined in the previous phase" (Gomaa, 2011). 

## Deployment 

Deployment is the process of "installing new/updated software on to the computer(s) so it can be used", and may include a "deployment plan" to outline details of the process (Marsic).

## Maintenance

Maintenance is a process to "record and triage" bugs that users encounter in the system and resolve them (Marsic).
