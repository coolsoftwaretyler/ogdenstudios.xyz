  "description": "Students for Sensible Drug Policy had an extremely bloated and broken WordPress installation. An outside firm had come in and done an absolutely horrendous job with the site's redesign, and afterwards we were unsure what to do. At the moment, I'm working on migrating us from WordPress to a headless CMS with a Hugo static site generator. ",

Students for Sensible Drug Policy maintained an in-house WordPress website from about 2012-2016. From 2015-2016, I was in charge of maintaining the blog posts, users, and updates of that WordPress installation. Over the 2015-2016 program year, we worked with a third party contractor to redesign and rebuild our website. The redesign was beautiful, modern, and brought us fully up to date with the modern trends of web design. But the implementation of that design was extremely poorly done. Over the course of the website launch, it became clear the company we had brought in didn't understand how to build functional and secure websites. That summer, our website was hacked due to multiple vulnerabilities with the 75+ WordPress plugins our contractors were relying on for the rebuild.

I learned very quickly how to troubleshoot a hacked, broken WordPress installation and was able to bring us back to a stable place where the bulk of our content was under our control. Over the course of the 2016-2017 program year, it becamse clear that even that content was barely functional. The website is slow, bloated, and in some cases full of inaccurate information.

In the 2017-2018 program year, I lobbied my managers to allow me to take over the website responsibilities full time. As a non-profit organization, we didn't originally have the budget or resources to allow me to spend my entire 40 hour work week on the website, but towards the beginning of the 2018 calendar year, we shifted our priorities and I've taken over our digital assets as a full time Systems Administrator.

As of September, 2018, the SSDP WordPress site is stable, a little cleaner, and in the process of migration. I've learned the WordPress framework like the back of my hand, along with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL development to fix a variety of bugs across the web property. I've watched as our Search Engine Optimization and AdWords accounts have been decimated by broken links and WordPress plugins.

To rectify the situation, we're tossing the entire WordPress installation in favor of a JAM stack. I'll be using a Headless CMS to implement the back end of a site built with the Hugo Static Site generator. At the moment, you can see progress made on the Hugo side of things [here](https://github.com/ogdenstudios/website-rebuild)
