Students for Sensible Drug Policy maintained an in-house WordPress website from about 2012-2016. From 2015-2016, I was in charge of maintaining the blog posts, users, and updates of that WordPress installation. Over the 2015-2016 program year, the organization hired a third party contractor to redesign and rebuild our website, and the results were ultimately unsatisfactory.

After some initial security and usability problems with the final product, I was able to get the site to a stable state.

To rectify the situation, we're tossing the entire WordPress installation in favor of a JAM stack. I'll be using a Headless CMS to implement the back end of a site built with the Hugo Static Site generator. At the moment, you can see progress on the Hugo side of things [here](https://github.com/ogdenstudios/website-rebuild)
