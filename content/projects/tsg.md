THC Staffing Group is an organization dedicated to closing the gap between America’s rapidly growing cannabis industry and diverse, qualified employment candidates. For the past year, I've provided copy-editing, WordPress maintenance, WCAG AA compliance work, and a full rebuild for them. The current website is their legacy WordPress installation while we develop a full rebuild using Hugo. You can find the rebuild repository [here](https://github.com/ogdenstudios/tsg-rebuild) and view progress at [https://tsg.netlify.com](https://tsg.netlify.com)
