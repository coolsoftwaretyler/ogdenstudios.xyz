nonprofits don't want your new prototype
they want money

they're run by staff of people who are close to the issue and well versed int he tactics to achieve the objectives 

start off with value assumptions:

you care about issues
you know about  the relevant organizations
the organizations you care about aren't already well funded (so exclude ACLU, etc.) 

you don't work for a major tech firm so can't give, say, free laptops 

things like: 
free hardware 
free enterprise software (google suite, adobe suite, microsoft suite, web hosting)
