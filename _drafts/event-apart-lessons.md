## dynamic type

Variable fonts can be faster, trigger fewer requests

Some fonts are getting shipped with it by default 

We could set up a design that really focuses on specifc variables

tag managers are a huge culprit

check out slide deck for the number of requests/size of requests of major websites

consider 24-40% of people are running ad blockers. what breaks for those people? How do we deliver content that won't get blocked

## generation style
[link](https://aneventapart.com/event/denver-2019#s16758)

pseudo elements are treated as dom children for flex/grid layout, but perhaps not :first-of-type and other types of selectors

useful because you have one surface on which you can do things

difficult because it's not always clear where content is coming from 

double colon is the correct standard now, but single color is backwards compatible and just fine 


## redefining the techncial possibilites of css

screen experiences that behave like an app

what if we had multi-col layout that smartly regenerated itself and was like a page

look to print media for this concept of 'i have pages with fixed dimensions, give me as many as i need'

we should use more scroll snapping 

[css regions would be sweet](https://webplatform.github.io/docs/tutorials/css-regions/) and they failed before, but perhaps there is something new and better on the horizon now that we have grid 

## intrinsic layouts

intrinsic layouts are the next hotness, past responsive web design

look into min-content, max-content for better sizing

we need to use more grid. let's design a reasonable single column experience for a fallback that is enhanced progressively by grid. 

let's do more with flexbox as well

grid placement algorithms can allow us to do really cool stuff

## mobile planet 

[link](https://aneventapart.com/event/denver-2019#s16753)

world pop: 5B people have mobile subscriptions, out of 5.6billion people 14 years old and up. that's w i l d

4B have smartphones. 

So we can pretty much reach every single person on their phones. 

only 1.3B active PCs 

a large responsibility to give people access to things across their phones. 

people spending 3hrs a day on the pone, most of their time in native mobile apps, very little in browsers. 

so there's a lot of investment in native mobile apps 

but lots of people are downloading and not using it. almost 25% are abandoned after the first use.

drop people directly into the core value - but again, grab the requirements before dropping people in there, but unobtrusively. 

people treat overlays as things to avoid. people are task focused. the more different a UI looks, the more quick they are to dismiss it. even when there's helpful stuff. 

product onboarding: get to product value asap, but not faster. ruthlessly edit distractions fro product value, teach in the moment with integrated UI

mobile web is great for unique visitors. website have better audiences than new mobile apps. links and sharing is easier through that medium. Sure, people only use web browsers 11m out of 169, but that's because the first two apps take up th emost time. 

unique actions happen on the web. 

it's not necessary navitve vs the web. 

web is good at reach, native apps are rich. 

what do people dislike the most when browsing the web: 

waiting for slow web pages 

interstitials 

mobile delays: more stressful than watching a horror movie.
