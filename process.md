# You want a website

You want a website but you don't really know where to start. That's my specialty. I'm a strong communicator with excellent technical skills and a wide breadth of experience. I'll help you make that thing.

# Start with your idea 

What do you want to do? Reach out to me. It's OK if it's vague, I'll work with you to formulate it. 

Intake call. 

# Let me formalize the project scope

Scope of work document, I'll take your ideas and articulate them. Send the doc to you for revisions. Send me back any changes, and if we both agree, work will start. 

# I'll make a playground

Set up the staging environment. I'll use the scope of work to determine appropriate technology. Often that means a WordPress site. Sometimes it's something else. I'll create a playground where I'll be able to show progress at different project milestones 

# you send me the content 

This is the most critical step of the whole process. Content is king on the web. It drives site navigation, layout, design, and functionality. The more content you send me, the more you will like the final product. 

At this stage I may come back to you with questions about what you have sent over. I may ask for more details, examples, or material. 

# I lay it all out 

With the content in hand, I'll set up the site navigation and overall page layouts on the staging site. This is a big-picture stage. I'll stage it for your review. At that point I'll ask you to clarify site structure, navigation, and any missing gaps in the overall layout. 

# We'll give it some personality 

At this stage, I'll curate font selections, color selections, and other pieces of components for your review. I'll give you options based on my professional experience. You select what you like the best and I'll put it together with the content and layout. 

# We'll bring it to life

After you approve content and design, I'll consult with you on hosting options. I can take care of the entire lifecycle for the deployment, and pass the keys to the site to you at the end.

# Everything is always documented

Projects change hands frequently. My goal is to hand you a finished product that you can hand off to another person on your team, or even a different web developer in the future. I'll provide documentation on the technical implementation and practical use of everything so you can use your site day-to-day, and have the power to maintain it in the long term. 

# Maintenance

I warranty all my work for 30 days of visual bugs and 90 days of critical bugs. 

Depending on my availability and the scope of your project, we may be able to negotiate ongoing maintenance for a retainer fee.

# Payment 

When I provide the scope of work, I'll break out all of these steps into detailed milestones. Each milestone will be paired with a price. That price will never change. Excluding additional scope, you'll know precisely the cost of your project before we agree to start work. 

Avoiding hourly charges incentivizes me to work quickly and meet deadlines. It also means you never have any billing surprises. 

Finally, if at any time one of us decides to end the project early, you'll only owe for the completed milestones. You won't pay for unfinished work or long contracts. You will only pay for the deliverables you actually have on-hand.
