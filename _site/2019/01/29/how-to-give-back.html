<p>nonprofits don’t want your new prototype
they want money</p>

<p>they’re run by staff of people who are close to the issue and well versed int he tactics to achieve the objectives</p>

<p>start off with value assumptions:</p>

<p>you care about issues
you know about  the relevant organizations
the organizations you care about aren’t already well funded (so exclude ACLU, etc.)</p>

<p>you don’t work for a major tech firm so can’t give, say, free laptops</p>

<p>things like: 
free hardware 
free enterprise software (google suite, adobe suite, microsoft suite, web hosting)</p>
