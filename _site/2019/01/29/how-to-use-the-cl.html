<p>When I first started doing web development, I had a friend ask me to fix their <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> site.</p>

<p>These days, I’d do it gladly and easily. In fact, this very website is built on Jekyll. But a year ago? I tried to install Jekyll and became immediately blocked because:</p>

<h2 id="the-documentation-tells-me-to-run-commands-but-where">The documentation tells me to “run” commands… but where?</h2>

<p>At this point in my journey, I had written plenty of code. I’d written HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and even C# and Java when I was a computer science student.</p>

<p>Not only that, I had also used the command line before. <em>I knew what the shell was</em>. I had worked in <em>Ubuntu</em>. But for the life of me, I could not spin up a Jekyll site through the command line.</p>

<p>I had all the prerequisite knowledge, but I didn’t have the application of putting it together in the context of web development.</p>

<h2 id="articulate-your-ideas-with-the-command-line">Articulate your ideas with the command line</h2>

<p>Here’s what I knew I wanted to do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Download the Jekyll site files to my computer (they were on GitHub)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Start a local server to view the current website</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get in the code and make changes to the look and feel.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s what I knew how to do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>None of that.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thinking in GUI terms, not in command line terms, this would have looked like:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Downloading the site files from a google drive, dropbox, or other link</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Making a folder on my desktop titled “target website”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Copying the files into that folder</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Installing a Jekyll server .msi file (or .dmg on mac)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clicking the Jekyll icon to start a server, pointing it at the target website directory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opening up the source code in an editor, editing the files, and checking my changes.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>It felt like a simple task, but I just could not, for the life of me, articulate those desires to the computer.</p>

<p>That’s what the command line is <em>for</em>, I just hadn’t learned to speak its language.</p>

<p>The problem is that no one had ever shown me this process. So I’m going to show it to you, and maybe I can save you a few months of frustration and disappointment.</p>

<p>First, let’s say a friend of yours asked you to edit a website. Their original designer put it up on GitHub and told them it’s a Jekyll site. Cool, you’ve never heard of it. But a website is a website, right?</p>

<p>They give you the github link…. now what?</p>

<h2 id="open-your-terminal">Open your terminal</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On mac, press <code class="highlighter-rouge">command here</code> on your keyboard. Or <code class="highlighter-rouge">search for terminal</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On ubuntu, press <code class="highlighter-rouge">command here</code> on your keyboard. Or <code class="highlighter-rouge">search for terminal</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On windows [wtf goes here?]</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Add pictures</p>

<h2 id="download-the-files">Download the files</h2>

<p>You’ve got the terminal open. Awesome. This is honestly further than many others have ever gotten. Now what?</p>
