From 2015-2016, I was in charge of maintaining the blog posts, users, and updates of that WordPress installation. Over the 2015-2016 program year, the organization hired a third party contractor to redesign and rebuild our website, and the results were ultimately unsatisfactory.\nAfter some initial security and usability problems with the final product, I was able to get the site to a stable state.\nTo rectify the situation, we\u0026rsquo;re tossing the entire WordPress installation in favor of a JAM stack. I\u0026rsquo;ll be using a Headless CMS to implement the back end of a site built with the Hugo Static Site generator.

When chapters log activity on the CAT, they earn CAT points. CAT points can be spent on SSDP materials, conference registrations, and other items that help support their work. The CAT is a way to earn resources (that would otherwise cost money) by logging activism and giving us a deeper insight in how our chapters do their work.\nCurrently, the SSDP CAT is built in Python in the Flask framework, but is being re-developed as Ruby on Rails app for wider support, utility, and maintainability.
