      <description>The SSDP Chapter Activity Tracker (CAT) is an online interface for SSDP chapters to log the activities they are engaging in. When chapters log activity on the CAT, they earn CAT points. CAT points can be spent on SSDP materials, conference registrations, and other items that help support their work. The CAT is a way to earn resources (that would otherwise cost money) by logging activism and giving us a deeper insight in how our chapters do their work.</description>
