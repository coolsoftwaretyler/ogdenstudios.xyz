      <description>Students for Sensible Drug Policy maintained an in-house WordPress website from about 2012-2016. From 2015-2016, I was in charge of maintaining the blog posts, users, and updates of that WordPress installation. Over the 2015-2016 program year, the organization hired a third party contractor to redesign and rebuild our website, and the results were ultimately unsatisfactory.
After some initial security and usability problems with the final product, I was able to get the site to a stable state.</description>

      <description>THC Staffing Group is an organization dedicated to closing the gap between Americaâ€™s rapidly growing cannabis industry and diverse, qualified employment candidates. For the past year, I&amp;rsquo;ve provided copy-editing, WordPress maintenance, WCAG AA compliance work, and a full rebuild for them. The current website is their legacy WordPress installation while we develop a full rebuild using Hugo. You can find the rebuild repository here and view progress at https://tsg.netlify.com</description>
