      <description>Students for Sensible Drug Policy maintained an in-house WordPress website from about 2012-2016. From 2015-2016, I was in charge of maintaining the blog posts, users, and updates of that WordPress installation. Over the 2015-2016 program year, the organization hired a third party contractor to redesign and rebuild our website, and the results were ultimately unsatisfactory.
After some initial security and usability problems with the final product, I was able to get the site to a stable state.</description>

      <description>The SSDP Chapter Activity Tracker (CAT) is an online interface for SSDP chapters to log the activities they are engaging in. When chapters log activity on the CAT, they earn CAT points. CAT points can be spent on SSDP materials, conference registrations, and other items that help support their work. The CAT is a way to earn resources (that would otherwise cost money) by logging activism and giving us a deeper insight in how our chapters do their work.</description>

      <description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.
No content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html
Setting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.
This implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js
Initial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml
[outputs] home = [&amp;quot;HTML&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;JSON&amp;quot;]  Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.</description>
