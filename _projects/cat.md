description: The SSDP Chapter Activity Tracker is a custom-built tool we use to track and reward volunteer activity across our global network. Since 2015, we have implemented this system through WordPress, Drupal, Flask, and soon will be rebuilding it as a Ruby on Rails app.

The SSDP Chapter Activity Tracker (CAT) is an online interface for SSDP chapters to log the activities they are engaging in. When chapters log activity on the CAT, they earn CAT points. CAT points can be spent on SSDP materials, conference registrations, and other items that help support their work. The CAT is a way to earn resources (that would otherwise cost money) by logging activism and giving us a deeper insight in how our chapters do their work.

Currently, the SSDP CAT is built in Python in the Flask framework, but is being re-developed as Ruby on Rails app for wider support, utility, and maintainability. You can see the Flask repository [here](https://github.com/SSDP-Dev/flask-cat).
