The SSDP Chapter Activity Tracker (CAT) is an online interface for SSDP chapters to log the activities they are engaging in. When chapters log activity on the CAT, they earn CAT points. CAT points can be spent on SSDP materials, conference registrations, and other items that help support their work. The CAT is a way to earn resources (that would otherwise cost money) by logging activism and giving SSDP a deeper insight in how their chapters do their work.

The CAT has gone through four major versions. It started as a WordPress theme, was ported to a Drupal application, migrated to the Flask framework, and finally built out in a stable fourth version with Ruby on Rails.
