description: I worked with the Maxar Creative Team to rebuild the DigitalGlobe website. This rebuild included migrating data from the old website, adding new content from the marketing team, and synthesizing old and new where possible. We built custom styles and functionality using SASS, Vanilla JavaScript, and some jQuery. The website is built on top of a Rails back end.
