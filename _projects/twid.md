title: This Week in Drugs 
description: In 2015, I co-founded the This Week in Drugs podcast. Over the course of the last three years, I've provided a variety of services to the podcast organization including audio editing, web design, web administration, and podcast publishing. In 2018 I archived the site and migrated it from a WordPress installation to a Jekyll static site for preservation, speed, and security.
