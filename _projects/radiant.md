description: I worked with the Maxar Creative Team to build out the Radiant Solutions website. We took their placeholder site, stripped out the Bootstrap framework, and implemented all custom styles and functionality using SASS, Vanilla JavaScript, and some light jQuery. The website is built on top of a Rails back end.
