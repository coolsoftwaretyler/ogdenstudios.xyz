title: Radiant Solutions
description: I worked with the Maxar Creative Team to build out the Radiant Solutions website. We took their placeholder site, stripped out the Bootstrap framework, and implemented all custom styles and functionality using Sass, JavaScript ES5, and some light jQuery. The website is built with a Rails back end.
