            <p>I'm Tyler Williams, Principal Developer at Ogden Studios. I build practical solutions for pragmatic people.</p>
            <p>I'm a full stack web developer with a strong background in Ruby on Rails, WordPress, and Jamstack. While I'm most comfortable working in these environments, I'm language and framework agnostic. For every project I take on, I choose the right tools for the job and provide excellent results using appropriate technologies.</p>
            <p>I'm particularly passionate about the lean web, accessibility, and security. I love developing with continuous deployment, and I believe in a free and open web.</p>
