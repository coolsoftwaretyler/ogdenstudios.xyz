# Ogden Studios 

I'm a full stack web developer with a strong background in Jamstack, React, Ruby on Rails, and Vue.js. While I'm most comfortable working in these environments, I consider myself language and framework agnostic. For every project I take on, I choose the right tools for the job and provide excellent results using appropriate technologies.

I'm particularly passionate about the lean web, accessibility, and the state of a free and open internet.
