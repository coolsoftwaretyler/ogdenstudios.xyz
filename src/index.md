# Ogden Studios 

I'm a full stack web developer with a strong background in Ruby on Rails, WordPress, and Jamstack. While I'm most comfortable working in these environments, I'm language and framework agnostic. For every project I take on, I choose the right tools for the job and provide excellent results using appropriate technologies.

I'm particularly passionate about the lean web, accessibility, and security. I love developing with continuous deployment, and I believe in a free and open web.
