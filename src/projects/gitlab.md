I recently joined [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) as a [Website Full Stack Developer](https://about.gitlab.com/job-families/marketing/marketing-full-stack-developer/). I haven't yet begun many role-specific tasks, but I'm excited to contribute to our design system, component library, and ongoing web projects.
