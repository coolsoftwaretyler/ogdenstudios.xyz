title: Shaleen Title
description: Shaleen Title is an Indian-American drug policy activist and attorney who currently serves as one of five commissioners on the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission, the agency tasked with regulating legal and medical marijuana in the commonwealth. She asked me for a classic and timeless rebuild of her website, which I completed using Jekyll as a static site generator, Netlify for continuous deployment, and Forestry as a content management system.
