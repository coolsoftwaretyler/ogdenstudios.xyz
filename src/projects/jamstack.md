I built a home page for [Shaleen Title](https://www.shaleentitle.com), one of five commissioners on the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission. It's built with Jekyll as a static site generator, Forestry for content management, and is hosted with Netlify.

[THC Staffing group](https://thcstaffinggroup.com) is an organization dedicated to closing the gap between America's rapidly growing cannabis industry and diverse, qualified employment candidates. I built out their website using Eleventy.

The [Love for Liberty Arnold-Simon DIPG Foundation](https://www.loveforliberty.org/) is a non-profit organization that fosters community and connections between and among bereaved DIPG families by providing bereavement services and support. I built their website with Hugo and host it on Netlify.
