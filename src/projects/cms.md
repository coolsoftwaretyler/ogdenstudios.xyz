[Sheila Vakharia](https://www.sheilavakharia.com/) is a researcher and activist at the Drug Policy Alliance. She asked for a custom WordPress theme for her website. I designed and implemented a WordPress theme from scratch for her. I did all the design work and tested the theme against the WordPress theme unit test and other WordPress theme requirements.

[Ellen Holland](https://ellenholland.xyz) is the senior editor of Cannabis Now Magazine. I designed, built, and deployed her personal website. 

I worked with [Jason Hernandez](https://www.getclemencynow.org/about-the-author) to organize, design, and deploy a Wix site to distribute his book, [Get Clemency Now](https://www.getclemencynow.org/), which helps incarcerated people pursue clemency.

In 2015, I co-founded the [This Week in Drugs](https://thisweekindrugs.org ) podcast. As a technical co-founder, I provided a variety of services to the podcast organization including audio editing, web design, web administration, and podcast publishing.
