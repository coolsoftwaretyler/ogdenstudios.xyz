I was part of the [Radiant Solutions](https://www.radiantsolutions.com/) website rebuild, [DigitalGlobe](https://www.digitalglobe.com/) website rebuild, and most recently the rebuild of the [Maxar corporate website](https://www.maxar.com/). 

For all of our corporate websites, I have consulted and made decisions about our architecture, backend capabilities, and frontend implementation. I maintain our automated testing suite, documentation, and have led the efforts to implement agile software development methodology. 

In addition to our corporate web properties, I build interactive applications to meet marketing goals in brand awareness and demand generation:

* [Explore Space with Maxar](https://explorespace.maxar.com)
* [2020 California Wildfires](https://blog.maxar.com/news-events/2020/maxar-and-mapbox-release-interactive-swir-imagery-map-of-california-wildfires)
* [Human Landscapes and COVID-19](https://microsites.maxar.com/human-landscapes/)

I've dramatically improved our team's turnaround time on these kinds of projects by building a mapping library with Vue.js, and a tool that allows our GIS team to import data and generate basic interactive maps.

We build our projects on top of Amazon Web Services and use Ruby on Rails, Vue.js, and Nuxt.js as appropriate. On any given day, I spend time writing HTML/CSS/JS, Vue.js, Ruby, SQL, and some configuration DSLs.
