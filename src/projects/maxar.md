I was part of the [Radiant Solutions](https://www.radiantsolutions.com/) website rebuild, [DigitalGlobe](https://www.digitalglobe.com/) website rebuild, and most recently the rebuild of the [Maxar corporate website](https://www.maxar.com/). 

I consulted and made decisions about architecture, backend capabilities, and frontend component systems. I maintain the automated testing suite, documentation, and led efforts to implement agile software development methodology across the Maxar web team.

In addition to corporate web properties, I built interactive applications to meet marketing goals in brand awareness and demand generation:

* [Enriching Maps](https://mapping.maxar.com/enriching-maps/)
* [Explore Space with Maxar](https://explorespace.maxar.com)
* [Human Landscapes and COVID-19](https://microsites.maxar.com/human-landscapes/)

I improved the team's turnaround time on these kinds of projects by building a mapping library with Vue.js, and a tool that allows our GIS team to import data and generate basic interactive maps.

At Maxar, I worked with Amazon Web Services, Ruby on Rails, Vue.js, and Nuxt.js. On any given day, I spent time writing HTML/CSS/JS, Vue.js, Ruby, SQL, and some configuration DSLs.
