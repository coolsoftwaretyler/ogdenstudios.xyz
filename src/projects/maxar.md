I was part of the [Radiant Solutions](https://www.radiantsolutions.com/) website rebuild, [DigitalGlobe](https://www.digitalglobe.com/) website rebuild, and most recently the rebuild of the [Maxar corporate website](https://www.maxar.com/). 

For all of our corporate websites, I have consulted and made decisions about our architecture, backend capabilities, and frontend implementation. I maintain our automated testing suite, documentation, and have led the efforts to implement agile software development methodology. 

In addition to our corporate web properties, I build interactive applications for marketing purposes, such as: 

* [Alaskan Resilience](https://microsites.maxar.com/alaskan-resilience/)
* [Explore Space with Maxar](https://explorespace.maxar.com)
* Interactive maps that [tell stories about COVID-19 data](https://microsites.maxar.com/human-landscapes/), [the 2020 California Wildfires](https://microsites.maxar.com/2020-california-wildfires/), and showcase [our capabilities](https://microsites.digitalglobe.com/interactive/footprints-coverage/)

To increase our turnaround time on these projects, I've built out a mapping component library with Vue.js, along with a map generator tool that creates configurable boilerplate maps, also built in Vue.js

We build our projects on top of Amazon Web Services and use Ruby on Rails, Vue.js, and Nuxt.js as appropriate. On any given day, I spend time writing HTML/CSS/JS, Vue.js, Ruby, SQL, and some configuration DSLs.
