I care quite a lot about computer science, software engineering, education, and the places where these fields intersect. I'm also a big Ruby on Rails fan, and I've been following Noah Gibbs for a while. It was a real treat to speak with him on his new podcast, *Computer Science: Just the Useful Bits*. We talk about my own non-traditional computer science background, the ways I think CS education is useful and not useful, and get into the weeds on Big-O notation and State Machines.
