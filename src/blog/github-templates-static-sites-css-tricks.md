I'm so excited to say I got a blog post published on CSS Tricks: [Using GitHub Template Repos to Jump-Start Static Site Projects](https://css-tricks.com/using-github-template-repos-to-jump-start-static-site-projects/).

I am so grateful to Chris and the CSS Tricks team for for accepting my pitch, based on my [previous blog post](https://ogdenstudios.xyz/2019/09/03/eleventy-github-repository-template.html) about it. 

The editing process was honestly really fun and easy. Chris and Geoff made my draft really come to life. 

Finally, I should mention I wouldn't have submitted my pitch without motivation from the [Shop Talk Show](https://shoptalkshow.com/). Chris and Dave have been so encouraging of people to write and submit technical blogs. They're also partially why I maintain this little blog as well. 

100% would recommend writing blog posts about web development.
