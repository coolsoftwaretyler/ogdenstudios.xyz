# Overview

This module will implement essential data structures. We'll build:

* Trees (binary search, red-black, binary, BST, AVL, 2-3, splay)
* Graphs (un/directed, un/weighted)
* Hash Tables 
* Heaps
* Linked Lists (singly linked, doubly linked, circularly linked) 
* Stacks
* Queues (inc. Priority)

For each data structure, I'll need to be able to implement the basic operations.
