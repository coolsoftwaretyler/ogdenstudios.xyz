# Overview

This module will implement essential data structures. We'll build:

* Trees (binary search, red-black, binary, BST, AVL, 2-3, splay)
* Graphs (un/directed, un/weighted)
* Hash Tables 
* Heaps
* Linked Lists (singly linked, doubly linked, circularly linked) 
* Stacks
* Queues (inc. Priority)

For each data structure, I'll need to be able to implement the basic operations. 

# Fundamental structures and implementation 

## Array data structure

Arrays are data structures that consist of a collection of element, identified by at least one index or key. an array is stored so the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by mathematical formula. 

The simplest array is a linear, or one-dimensional array. 

Arrays can be used to represent: 

* lists
* heaps
* hash tables
* deques 
* queues 
* stacks
* strings

## Linked data structure

Linked data structures consist of data records (nodes), linked together and organized by references (links or pointers). 

If no arithmetic is done on indices the data structure is a linked one. 

Linked data structures include: 

* linked lists
* search trees
* expression trees
