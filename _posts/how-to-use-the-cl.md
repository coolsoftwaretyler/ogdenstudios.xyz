common commands and their GUI counterparts 

zsh vs bash vs csh? 

bash profiles? 

When I first started doing web development, I had a friend ask me to fix their [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site. 

These days, I'd do it gladly and easily. In fact, this very website is built on Jekyll. But a year ago? I tried to install Jekyll and became immediately blocked because:

## The documentation tells me to "run" commands... but where? 

At this point in my journey, I had written plenty of code. I'd written HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and even C# and Java when I was a computer science student.

Not only that, I had also used the command line before. *I knew what the shell was*. I had worked in *Ubuntu*. But for the life of me, I could not spin up a Jekyll site through the command line. 

I had all the prerequisite knowledge, but I didn't have the application of putting it together in the context of web development. 

## Articulate your ideas with the command line

Here's what I knew I wanted to do: 

1. Download the Jekyll site files to my computer (they were on GitHub)

2. Start a local server to view the current website 

3. Get in the code and make changes to the look and feel. 

Here's what I knew how to do: 

1. None of that. 

Thinking in GUI terms, not in command line terms, this would have looked like: 

1. Downloading the site files from a google drive, dropbox, or other link 

2. Making a folder on my desktop titled "target website"

3. Copying the files into that folder 

4. Installing a Jekyll server .msi file (or .dmg on mac)

5. Clicking the Jekyll icon to start a server, pointing it at the target website directory 

6. Opening up the source code in an editor, editing the files, and checking my changes. 

It felt like a simple task, but I just could not, for the life of me, articulate those desires to the computer. 

That's what the command line is *for*, I just hadn't learned to speak its language.

The problem is that no one had ever shown me this process. So I'm going to show it to you, and maybe I can save you a few months of frustration and disappointment. 

First, let's say a friend of yours asked you to edit a website. Their original designer put it up on GitHub and told them it's a Jekyll site. Cool, you've never heard of it. But a website is a website, right? 

They give you the github link.... now what? 

## Open your terminal 

- On mac, press `command here` on your keyboard. Or `search for terminal`. 

- On ubuntu, press `command here` on your keyboard. Or `search for terminal`. 

- On windows [wtf goes here?]

Add pictures

## Download the files

You've got the terminal open. Awesome. This is honestly further than many others have ever gotten. Now what?
